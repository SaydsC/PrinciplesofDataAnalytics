Principles of Data Analytics module SS24

# Outline
This project asked us to  create a single Jupyter notebook named penguins.ipynb.

#### Technologies
To run the noteboook on your local machine you will need Pyhton 3.9 or above. This notebook has been completed using Anaconda and the following imported the following libraries;

'''

- import pandas as pd
- import numpy as np
- import matplotlib.pyplot as plt #for plotting
- import seaborn as sns

#### Setup
To run this notebook on a local machine you should do the following:

Open the command line on your machine. I use terminal in Visual Studio code but also recommend CMDer if working on a Windows device.
Navigate to the directory that contains the downloaded notebook
In the terminal type "Jupyter Notebook" and press "Enter"
This will open the notebook on the Jupyter browser
For this project I used visual studio code for ease of pushing to GitHub.
